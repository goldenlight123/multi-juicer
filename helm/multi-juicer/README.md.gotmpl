Running CTFs and Security Trainings with [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop) is usually quite tricky, Juice Shop just isn't intended to be used by multiple users at a time.
Instructing everybody how to start Juice Shop on their own machine works ok, but takes away too much valuable time.

MultiJuicer gives you the ability to run separate Juice Shop instances for every participant on a central kubernetes cluster, to run events without the need for local Juice Shop instances.

> **Note:** This project was called JuicyCTF until recently. This was changed to avoid confusions with the [juice-shop-ctf](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf) project.

**What it does:**

- dynamically create new Juice Shop instances when needed
- runs on a single domain, comes with a LoadBalancer sending the traffic to the participants Juice Shop instance
- backup and auto apply challenge progress in case of Juice Shop container restarts
- cleanup old & unused instances automatically
