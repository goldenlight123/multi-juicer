# [WIP] Example Setup with AWS

**NOTE:** This Guide is still a "Work in Progress", if you got any recommendations or issues with it, please post them into the related issue: https://github.com/iteratec/multi-juicer/issues/15

**WARNING:** The resources created in this guide will cost about \$70.00/month. The actual price might depend on its usage, but make sure to delete the resources as described in Step 5 Deinstallation when you do not need them anymore.

## Prerequisites

This example expects you to have the following cli tools setup.

1. [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
2. [eksctl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html)
3. [helm](https://helm.sh)
4. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-macos)

```sh
# First we'll need a cluster, you can create one using the DigitalOcean cli.
# This will take a couple of minutes
eksctl create cluster \
--name multi-juicer \
--version 1.13 \
--nodegroup-name standard-workers \
--node-type t3.medium \
--nodes 2 \
--nodes-min 1 \
--nodes-max 4 \
--node-ami auto

# After completion verify that your kubectl context has been updated:
# Should print something like: Administrator@multi-juicer.eu-central-1.eksctl.io
kubectl config current-context
```

## Step 2. Installing MultiJuicer via helm

```sh
# You'll need to add the multi-juicer helm repo to your helm repos
helm repo add multi-juicer https://iteratec.github.io/multi-juicer/

# for helm <= 2
helm install multi-juicer/multi-juicer --name multi-juicer

# for helm >= 3
helm install multi-juicer multi-juicer/multi-juicer

# kubernetes will now spin up the pods
# to verify every thing is starting up, run:
kubectl get pods
# This should show you three pods a juice-balancer pod and two redis pods
# Wait until all 3 pods are ready
```

## Step 3. Verify the app is running correctly

This step is optional, but helpful to catch errors quicker.

```sh
# lets test out if the app is working correctly before proceeding
# for that we can port forward the JuiceBalancer service to your local machine
kubectl port-forward service/juice-balancer 3000:3000

# Open up your browser for localhost:3000
# You should be able to see the MultiJuicer Balancer UI

# Try to create a team and see if everything works correctly
# You should be able to access a JuiceShop instances after a few seconds after creating a team,
# and after clicking the "Start Hacking" Button

# You can also try out if the admin UI works correctly
# Go back to localhost:3000/balancer
# To log in as the admin log in as the team "admin"
# The password for the team gets autogenerated if not specified, you can extract it from the kubernetes secret:
kubectl get secrets juice-balancer-secret -o=jsonpath='{.data.adminPassword}' | base64 --decode
```

## Step 4. Add Ingress to expose the app to the world

**WARNING:** I, as a AWS Noob, haven't yet figured out how to get it working correctly.
The Guide below shows **how I thing it should work** but it doesn't. At least not for me. If you are a AWS Pro please please send me a message / open up an issue / pull request correcting this section.

AWS let's you create LoadBalancer by adding a new ingress config to you cluster.
To set this up follow the **To deploy the ALB Ingress Controller to an Amazon EKS cluster** guide on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html closely. This will walk you through setting up and configuring the ingress.

After you have set that up we can now create a ingress config for our the MultiJuicer Stack.

```sh
# create the ingress for the JuiceBalancer service
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iteratec/multi-juicer/master/guides/aws/aws-ingress.yaml
kubectl apply -f aws-ingress.yaml
```

## Step 5. Deinstallation

helm delete multi-juicer

```sh
# helm will not delete the persistent volumes for redis!
# delete them by running:
kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaims redis-data-multi-juicer-redis-master-0 redis-data-multi-juicer-redis-slave-0

# Delete the loadbalancer
kubectl delete -f aws-ingress.yaml

# Delete the kubernetes cluster
eksctl delete cluster multi-juicer
```
